# Sequence Translator
## Sophie Tanker

This was a personal project created to expand my knowledge of python OOP and bioinformatics concepts.

Future plans for this project include but are not limited to:
- ~~translating input files so they do not have to be pre-translated~~
- adding Pandas/Seaborn compatibility to do AT/GC analysis
- utilizing the dictionary.py file to practice passing data from one script to another
